        <h2>General Background</h2>
      <p> OpenGL under Python is largely the same as OpenGL under most
other languages, so you can use much of             the documentation
you'll find around the Internet, or in your local bookstore.&nbsp; This
page primarily provides links to PyOpenGL-specific documentation.
&nbsp;Users of OpenGLContext should also see the <a href="http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/context/documentation.html">OpenGLContext
documentation page</a>.</p>

      <h2>References</h2>

      <h2>Books</h2>
      <p>There
are a large number of very good books on OpenGL available. Many
of these books cover "legacy" OpenGL, rather than the
shader/buffer/texture model of OpenGL 3.0. Still, they provide a
good grounding that allows you to learn the basics of OpenGL.</p>
<h4>OpenGL Programming Guide: (The Red Book)</h4><p>Older versions of the official OpenGL Programming Guide, a.k.a
"The Red Book" are available online in <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=OpenGL+Programming+Guide">various
places</a> (version 2.0 covers OpenGL 1.1). If you are serious about
learning OpenGL, the newer versions of the Red Book, (v3.0) is likely on
the shelves of your local bookstore, and is quite readable.
      </p>
      <p>You'll find versions of some of the Red Book tutorial code for
Python included in the PyOpenGL-Demo/redbook directory of the PyOpenGL-Demo
distribution. These versions are very close to the original source
code. The OpenGLContext tests directory also has four of the
tutorials converted, "alpha", "alpha3D", "surface" and "trim".
      </p>
      <p> Addison-Wesley Pub Co; ISBN: 0201604582 ; 3rd edition (August
6, 1999)</p><h4>OpenGL Shading Language: (The Orange Book)</h4><p>This
book serves as a good introduction to shaders. The shaders
described cover the gamut from the simplest 1-line shaders through code
to emulate legacy operation to non-realistic shading to caustics and
the like. You will generally have to adapt any code you take from
here to work with your real-world scenes, but the book offers a strong
grounding.</p><p>Addison-Wesley Pub Co: ISBN: 978-0-321-33489-3; 2nd edition</p><h4>OpenGL Super-Bible</h4><p>This
book is an all-round introduction, working up from OpenGL 1.0 era
operations all the way to OpenGL 2.x era behaviours. Coverage of
newer features tends to be somewhat sketchy, but coverage of older
features is extensive. It is notable mainly for being somewhat
up-to-date and having exhaustive coverage of what it covers. The
book also makes a great anchor for your average supertanker.</p><p>Sams Pub: ISBN 0-672-32601-9; 3rd edition</p>

      <h2>NeHe Tutorials</h2>
      <p>When people think of an "OpenGL tutorial", many will
immediately think of the NeHe tutorials by Jeff Molofee, available at <a href="http://nehe.gamedev.net/">http://nehe.gamedev.net/</a>
these
tutorials range from the very simple (create an OpenGL window) through
the advanced (particle systems, loading scenes from various formats,
displaying video textures, text, morphing, multi-texturing). The
older tutorials tend to be legacy-mode operations, so you should keep
in mind that they are describing old ways of working as you learn with
them.</p>
      <p>The NeHe tutorials are so popular that there are multiple
Python translations available:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Included in PyOpenGL-Demo you'll find a
subdirectory NeHe, which includes translations of tutorials 1 through 6,
with a multi-texturing version of tutorial 6 as well. These
translations are very close in their approach to the original tutorial's
approach in terms of their structure and organization. As a
result, they can be somewhat hard to follow as Python code unless you
are following along with the tutorial text and reading the reasoning
behind the C code.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.pygame.org/gamelets/#NEHE">PyGame-specific</a>
versions by Paul Furber. These are tightly coded direct
translations of the NeHe code, idiomatic (function-oriented) Python.
Tutorials 1 through 10 are available.</li>
        <li>Included with OpenGLContext, in the tests directory, you'll
find a number of files named nehe*.py, these are, as you might expect,
translations of the corresponding tutorials. These translations
are results-focused, they do not follow the tutorial's structure,
instead they use best (object-oriented) practices in Python programming,
and particularly OpenGLContext programming without completely violating
the idea of the tutorials (they try to keep the executed code in a
single file, with minimal external dependencies). Tutorials 1 through 8
are translated, with the glprint.py test being a loose translation of
tutorial 13 (bitmapped text). The OpenGLContext <a href="http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/context/documentation.html">documentation
collection</a> includes the source online, with brief discussions of the
differences from the tutorial code.</li>
        <li>The NeHe tutorials themselves link to (very old)
translations which very closely followed the original tutorial
structure. These tutorials served as the base for the versions in
the PyOpenGL distribution. I would not recommend using them for
learning PyOpenGL.</li>
