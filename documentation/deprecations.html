<h1>OpenGL 3.x Deprecations</h1>


<p class="introduction">This document describes the OpenGL 3.x (and
above) deprecation model and attempts to provide advice on how to
migrate your (PyOpenGL) code to be OpenGL 3.1 compatible or write code
which is "legacy free" or "forward compatible".</p>



<h2>Background</h2><p>The OpenGL 3.0 specification has for the first
time introduced the concept of deprecations to the OpenGL API.
&nbsp;Before this, OpenGL has never before deprecated any entry point
in close to 17 years of development.</p><p>Originally it was intended
that OpenGL 3.0 would be a "hard break" with previous OpenGL versions
that would allow for a sleek and simple API for game-engine developers,
sacrificing the "newbie friendliness" of the legacy API in order to
better match the behaviour of modern GPU hardware. &nbsp;(This was the
"Longs Peak" proposal, which had been eagerly awaited by the few
remaining OpenGL game developers.)</p><p>The ARB, however did not
implement the "Longs Peak" proposal in OpenGL 3.0, instead introducing
just a set of deprecations which includes almost all of the original
OpenGL API, including most entry points that OpenGL users have seen as
"characterizing" the API such as those related to individual vertices
and display-list behaviour. &nbsp;For OpenGL 3.0, these APIs are still
available, but the intent is that with OpenGL 3.1 the APIs will no
longer be available at all.</p><p>The deprecated APIs are often
referred to as "legacy" APIs, while "forward compatible" or "legacy
free" is used to describe those APIs which are part of the OpenGL 3.1
subset. &nbsp;During the OpenGL 3.0 to 3.1 period you will likely need
to convert your PyOpenGL code to use forward compatible APIs while
still providing "legacy" support using the deprecated APIs.</p><p>Currently
(March, 2009) almost all PyOpenGL code uses the "legacy" APIs, as such
if you have a PyOpenGL code-base you will likely need to do some work
to rewrite your code using forward compatible entry points.</p><p>For more background, you may wish to view the <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2009/conference/schedule/event/94/">PyCon 2009 presentation</a> on the topic.</p><h2>Changes Required</h2><p>The biggest changes you will likely need to accomplish in order to be OpenGL 3.1 ready:</p><ul><li>If
you have any per-vertex rendering code, you will need to convert it to
array-based rendering. &nbsp;You can safely do this for all current
video cards, as array-based rendering has been standard since OpenGL 1.1</li><ul><li>Once
you have done this, it is a trivial change to begin using Vertex Buffer
Objects (VBOs), which usage is required by OpenGL 3.1 and provides a
significant performance win for most non-streaming array usage.</li></ul><li>If you use display lists, you will need to stop using them and convert to array-based geometry</li><li>If you are using the individual quad anti-pattern for fonts/sprites, you will need to recode, likely as arrays/shaders</li><li>You
will need to calculate your own transformation matrices. &nbsp;We may
wind up providing a C extension to make this more efficient for
PyOpenGL code.</li><li>You will need to begin using shaders, and eventually convert to only using shaders (rather than legacy OpenGL shading/texturing)</li></ul><h2>Tools</h2>

<p>PyOpenGL includes a flag OpenGL.FORWARD_COMPATIBLE_ONLY, which this
flag is set to True before importing OpenGL.GL then the OpenGL.GL entry
points which are not forward compatible are disabled and will raise
OpenGL.error.NullFunctionError exceptions on any attempt to call them.</p><pre>import OpenGL<br>OpenGL.FORWARD_COMPATIBLE_ONLY = True<br>from OpenGL.GL import *<br>from OpenGL.GLU import *<br>...</pre><p>You
would normally only set the flag once you've finished what you believe
to be your whole conversion, to check that you've cleaned up all of the
entry points.</p><p class="technical">Note that this flag does not attempt to disable GLU, GLUT, GLE or GLX
functions which are deprecated, as we don't currently know which of
those entry points will be deprecated and which will be re-implemented
as OpenGL 3.1-compatible code.</p><p class="footer"><a href="index.html"><img src="../images/doc_logo_icon.gif" title="" alt="Documentation" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 32px; height: 32px;" align="middle"></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/"><img alt="PyOpenGL" src="../images/icon2.jpg" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 32px; height: 32px;" align="middle"></a>
