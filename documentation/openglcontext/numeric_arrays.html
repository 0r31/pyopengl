        <td>
        Numeric Python makes it easy to work with (potentially large) homogenous
        arrays of a given data type.&nbsp; It provides extended slicing
        semantics for dealing with multidimensional arrays, utility functions
        for processing all elements of an array, and mechanisms for storing and
        converting to/from arrays and native Python data structures.

        <td><p>Before it can be used, Numeric Python needs to be imported into
          your module.&nbsp; Depending on how many of the functions in the
          module you'll be wanting to use, you may use either <code>from Numeric import *</code> 
          or <code>import Numeric</code>  to gain access.</p>
          <p>Creating a Numeric array is done with one of a set of functions,
          each of which has a particular purpose (note, these are just the
          commonly used functions):</p>

          <p>Array dimensions are specified as tuples, in the order of
          indexing.&nbsp; The current shape of an array can be retrieved using
          the <code>shape( some_array )</code> function.&nbsp; You can use the
          <code>reshape</code>, <code>resize</code>, <code>transpose</code>, and <code>ravel</code> functions to get a copy of an array with
          different dimensions. Note: most Numeric functions allow for in-place
          copying through an optional extra argument specifying the destination
          for the operation.&nbsp; See the Numeric Python manual for details.&nbsp;</p>

      <tr>
        <th width="24%" valign="top"><p>Basic Manipulations</p>
        <td>
          <h3>Basic Mathematics</h3>
          <p>Mathematical operators tend to work element-wise for arrays, and allow for a
          fairly wide variety of second arguments.</p>
          <p>For instance, to
          multiply an entire array by 3.0, you would write <code>result = myarray *
          3.0</code> with similar approaches for addition, subtraction, and division.</p>
          <p>If, instead, you wanted to multiply each element in one array by
          the corresponding element in another array, you would write <code>result = firstarray *
          secondarray</code> again, with the same approach working for most basic math
          operations.</p>
          <h3>Slicing</h3>
          <p>Numeric Python uses an extended slicing notation, which allows for
          flexible and powerful manipulation of multidimensional arrays (though
          at the price of making the slice specifications somewhat less
          intuitive looking).</p>
          <p>The syntax for the extended slicing notation goes like this:</p>
          <p>[ start : stop <i>: step</i>, start : stop <i>: step</i>, ... ]</p>
          <p>with one start, stop, step set allowed (but not required beyond the
          first) for each dimension of the array. The step argument and the
          preceding colon can be left off unless actually needed.&nbsp; As with
          standard slicing notation, if you leave off a start value, zero is
          assumed, and if you leave off a stop value, the end of the array is
          assumed.</p>
          <p>Generally it is easiest to understand the slicing notation through
          examples. Consider this interactive session:</p>
          <pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; m = array( [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12],[13,14,15,16]], 'd')
&gt;&gt;&gt; m
array([[  1.,   2.,   3.,   4.],
       [  5.,   6.,   7.,   8.],
       [  9.,  10.,  11.,  12.],
       [ 13.,  14.,  15.,  16.]])</pre>
          <pre># item 0 of the array in first dimension
&gt;&gt;&gt; m[0] 
array([ 1.,  2.,  3.,  4.])</pre>
          <pre># item 1 of the array in first dimension
&gt;&gt;&gt; m[1] 
array([ 5.,  6.,  7.,  8.])</pre>
          <pre># item 0 of the array in second dimension
&gt;&gt;&gt; m[:,0] 
array([  1.,   5.,   9.,  13.])</pre>
          <pre># item 1 of the array in second dimension
&gt;&gt;&gt; m[:,1] 
array([  2.,   6.,  10.,  14.])</pre>
          <pre># all items in first dimension taking every 
# second item
&gt;&gt;&gt; m[::2] 
array([[  1.,   2.,   3.,   4.],
       [  9.,  10.,  11.,  12.]])
</pre>
          <pre># as previous, but now take item 1 in the 
# second dimension for each row
&gt;&gt;&gt; m[::2,1] 
array([  2.,  10.])</pre>
          <pre># as previous, but starting the slice of first dimension 
# at the second item (i.e. take 1 and 3 instead of 0 and 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; m[1::2,1] 
array([  6.,  14.])
&gt;&gt;&gt; </pre>
        <p>
        Common slices you'll see include:</p>
          <pre># x-coordinate of an i*3 array
xes = points[:,0]
yes = points[:,1]</pre>
          <pre># first points of i*3 set of points describing triangles
firstPoints = trianglePoints[::3]
secondPoints = trianglePoints[1::3]</pre>
          <pre># r-values of an x*y*3 r,g,b image
reds = image[:,:,0]
greens = image[:,:,1]</pre>
        <h3>
        Multiplication</h3>
          <p>There are three different types of multiplication commonly used in
          OpenGLContext. Element-wise multiplication was covered in Basic
          Mathematics above.&nbsp; The other two common multiplication types are
          dot product and cross product.&nbsp; Numeric Python provides a dot
          product function:</p>
          <pre>result = dot( first, second )</pre>
        <p>
        Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to provide any cross product function, so
        the OpenGLContext utility module provides its own cross product function
        (currently implemented in Python, potentially implemented in C in the
        future):</p>
          <pre>from OpenGLContext.utilities import crossprod
result = crossprod( (ux, uy, uz, uw), (vx, vy, vz, vw) )</pre>
          <p>When working with arrays of vectors, the triangleutilities function
          crossProduct should be used, as it will process the entire array of
          vectors using Numeric Python mechanisms (instead of calling a Python
          function for every vector).</p>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th width="24%" valign="top"><p>Array Processing Functions</p>
        <td>
        <p>The basic manipulations above are primarily useful for selecting a
        particular subset of an array for processing, while the array processing
        functions do the bulk of the calculations in most algorithms.&nbsp;
        Because of the number of functions, you should use the Numeric Python
        Handbook for descriptions of the functions.</p>
        <h3>Universal (Math) Functions</h3>
        <p>These function-like objects provide for extremely flexible
        application of common mathematical operations on arguments of varying
        type.</p>
        <p><code>absolute,  add, arccos, arcsin, arctan,  arctan2, bitwise_and,
        bitwise_or, bitwise_xor,  ceil,  conjugate, cos, cosh,  divide,
        divide_safe,  equal,  exp, fabs,  floor, fmod,  greater, greater_equal,
        hypot,  invert, left_shift,  less, less_equal,  log,  log10, logical_and,
        logical_not, logical_or, logical_xor,  maximum,  minimum,  multiply,  negative,
        not_equal,  power,  remainder, right_shift,  sin, sinh, sqrt,  subtract,  tan,  tanh</code></p>
        <h3>Index(ed)-Array Functions</h3>
        <p>These functions deal with index arrays or indexed arrays, that is,
        arrays which refer to other arrays, either by having equivalent
        structure, or including actual indices into the other array. These
        functions can provide efficient operation by not requiring you to copy
        the arrays being processed.&nbsp; For an example, see
        OpenGLContext.scenegraph.polygonsort's use of argsort to generate the
        indices required for rendering sorted transparent geometry without
        needing to copying/rearranging the point array.</p>
        <p><code>argmax, argmin, argsort, choose, take, where, put, putmask, compress</code></p>
        <h3>Binary Operator Functions</h3>
        <p>These functions deal with two &quot;data arrays&quot;, combining
        their values in some way to create a new array.&nbsp; The most commonly
        used function of this group is dot.</p>
        <p><code>convolve, cross_correlate, dot, outerproduct, innerproduct, sum</code></p>
        <h3> Array Value</h3>
        <p>These functions produce single value outputs from an entire array,
        checking, for instance, that the entire array is true, or calculating
        the sum of the entire array.</p>
        <p><code>alltrue, cumproduct, cumsum, product, sometrue, trace</code></p>
        <h3>Altered Array Values</h3>
        <p>These functions produce a copy of an array with each value modified
        by the given function, or the array's ordering/contents modified as
        dictated by the function's rules of operation.</p>
        <p><code>around, clip, sign, sort, compress</code></p>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th width="24%" valign="top"><p>The OpenGLContext Utility Modules</p>
        <td>
        There are a number of functions not provided by Numeric Python which are
        common and useful enough that they are included in the OpenGLContext
        utility module.&nbsp; The cross product function was mentioned above,
        also available are:
        <dl>
          <dt>rotMatrix( (x,y,z,a) )</dt>
          <dd>Given rotation as x,y,z,a (a in radians), return rotation matrix</dd>
          <dt>normalise( vector)</dt>
          <dd>Given a 3 or 4-item vector, return a 3-item unit vector</dd>
          <dt>crossprod( (ux, uy, uz, uw), (vx, vy, vz, vw) )</dt>
          <dd>Given 2 4-item vectors, return the cross product as a 4-item vector</dd>
          <dt>mag( vector )</dt>
          <dd>Given a 3 or 4-item vector, return the vector's magnitude</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>The vectorutilities module provides similar functions for operating
        on entire arrays of vectors (they can also work with individual vectors,
        but are not generally convenient for such operation).</p>
        <p>Note, the current set of utility modules is not ideal, it is likely
        that the &quot;utility&quot; module will largely go away with the
        explicit utility modules (vector, triangle) replacing its functionality.

        <th width="24%" valign="top"><p>Array-based Geometry</p>
        <td>
        OpenGL 1.1 introduced a number of geometry-specification mechanisms
        based on specifying pointers to arrays of data values.&nbsp; The OpenGL
        implementation was passed the entire array of data, then would loop
        through the array (normally at hardware speed) dispatching a command for
        each of those values in the array which were indicated.&nbsp; The
        user-side code need only make a single call to have potentially
        thousands of data values passed rendering pipeline.
        <p>With C code, the difference between the array-based code and
        individual calls to transfer data values was noticeable, but it is still
        quite practical to use the individual calls in many instances.&nbsp;
        With Python code, however, it is generally impractical to use individual
        data transfer calls, as the overhead for the API call is enormous
        compared to the actual work being done with such low level functions.</p>
        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>The basic approach of the array-based geometry is to specify a
        pointer for a number of different array types: vertex, color, normal and
        textureCoordinate (potentially multiple coordinates if using
        multi-texturing).</p>
        <pre>glVertexPointerd( self.verticies )
glColorPointerd ( self.colours )
glNormalPointerd ( self.normals )
glTexCoordPointerd( self.textures )</pre>
        <p>This tells the OpenGL engine that these are the active arrays for
        each of these types.&nbsp; For all of the arrays save texture
        coordinates, only one active array is possible.&nbsp; Where
        multi-texturing is enabled (multi-texturing is an OpenGL extension not
        available on all platforms), you can specify one active texture
        coordinate array for each texture engine.</p>
        <p>Once you have specified the active arrays, you enable or disable each
        array type you wish to use for a given call.</p>
        <pre>glEnable( GL_VERTEX_ARRAY )
glEnable( GL_COLOR_ARRAY )
glEnable( GL_NORMAL_ARRAY )
glEnable( GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY )</pre>
        <p>The array drawing calls such as glDrawArrays and glDrawElements are
        called in place of a glBegin, glEnd construct (including the glVertex,
        glColor, glNormal, glTexCoord, etc. calls that normally go between
        them).&nbsp; The array drawing call will specify the primitive type to
        draw (the same values as for glBegin), and potentially a subset of the
        arrays which is to be drawn (for instance, a start position, a count of
        items to draw, or a list of indices into the arrays which are to be
        drawn).</p>
